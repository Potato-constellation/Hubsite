    <br>
Games is websites with games on them. Videos is websites with videos on them. 
Quality of Life is just quality of life stuff. Books is websites with books on them. Miscellanous 
is the stuff that I cant decide where it goes. Suggestions is where you can suggest websites
and report bugs. Short stories are short stories that I wrote myself. recommended sites are sites that
i've chosen as some of the best we here and you will probably be visiting the most. 
<br>
<br>
I will code a website for you for starting at 5 USD(United states dollar) then scaling
with the size and complexity of the website for inquiries email potatolord2009@gmail.com
P.S. I won't code anything illegal or pornographic in nature. Additionally if you have
any questions email the same gmail also please try to be somewhat professional in your emails.
